# Cursor Rules for Braille Card and Cylinder STL Generator

## Git Commit and Push Workflow

When the user asks to commit and/or push code to GitHub (including phrases like "prepare a commit", "prepare a commit and push", "commit and push", "push to github", etc.):

**Preferred approach: Prepare commands for manual execution** - This method has proven reliable (successful commit 2024-12-06). While Cursor's direct git execution may have inconsistent output display, preparing commands for manual terminal execution ensures the user has full visibility and control.

1. **Prepare the commands for manual execution:**
   - Check git status to identify modified, staged, and untracked files
   - Review the changes using git diff
   - Check recent commit history to follow the repository's commit message style
   - Draft an appropriate commit message that:
     - Summarizes the nature of changes (feature, enhancement, bug fix, refactoring, docs, etc.)
     - Is concise (1-2 sentences for simple changes, or multi-line for complex changes)
     - Follows the repository's existing commit message conventions
   - Identify the current branch and remote tracking branch

2. **Provide ready-to-use PowerShell commands:**
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\WATAP\Documents\github\braille-card-and-cylinder-stl-generator"

   git add -A

   git commit -m "Commit message here"

   git push origin [branch-name]
   ```

3. **Include clear instructions:**
   - Explain what each command does
   - Tell the user to copy and paste the commands into their terminal
   - Mention that they can modify the commit message if needed before executing

**Note:** As of 2024-12-06, manual execution of prepared git commands has been verified to work successfully on the first attempt when pre-commit hooks don't require file modifications.

## Pre-Commit Hook Failure Workaround

This repository uses pre-commit hooks that automatically fix files (trailing whitespace, end-of-file newlines, ruff formatting). **When the hooks fix files, the commit will fail** because the modified files are no longer staged.

**Symptom:**
```
[WARNING] Unstaged files detected.
trim trailing whitespace.................................................Failed
- files were modified by this hook
fix end of files.........................................................Failed
- files were modified by this hook
ruff format..............................................................Failed
- files were modified by this hook
```

**Solution - Re-stage and commit again:**
```powershell
# After a failed commit due to pre-commit hooks fixing files:
git add -A
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# The second attempt should succeed because the hooks already fixed the files
```

**Always include this note when providing commit commands:**
> If the commit fails with "files were modified by this hook", run `git add -A` and `git commit -m "..."` again. The second attempt will succeed.

## Additional Git Guidelines

- Always check for sensitive information before preparing commits
- Ensure commit messages are descriptive and follow conventional commit style when appropriate
- For large changesets, consider breaking into multiple logical commits
- Always verify the correct branch before pushing
- Always use `git add -A` to stage all changes (including files fixed by pre-commit hooks)
