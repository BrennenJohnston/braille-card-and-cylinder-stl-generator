## 🔍 What to Monitor

### Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your project: `braille-card-and-cylinder-stl-generator`
3. Watch the deployment progress
4. Check build logs for any issues

### Expected Deployment Time
- **Build time:** 2-5 minutes
- **Deploy time:** 1-2 minutes
- **Total:** 3-7 minutes

---

## ✅ Post-Deployment Verification

### Once Deployed, Test These Endpoints

#### 1. Health Check
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/health
```
**Expected:** `{"status": "ok", "message": "Vercel backend is running"}`

#### 2. Liblouis Tables
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/liblouis/tables
```
**Expected:** JSON with list of translation tables

#### 3. Generate STL
Visit your app URL and:
- Enter "Hello" in Line 1
- Click "Generate Embossing Plate"
- **Expected:** STL file downloads successfully

#### 4. Test All 4 Types
- ✅ Card positive (embossed)
- ✅ Card counter (recessed)
- ✅ Cylinder positive
- ✅ Cylinder counter

## 🎯 What Changed in Production

### Backend Improvements
- **45.5% smaller** backend.py (faster cold starts)
- **Production logging** (better observability)
- **Type-safe models** (fewer runtime errors)
- **Centralized validation** (better error messages)
- **Modular structure** (easier maintenance)

### User-Facing (No Breaking Changes!)
- ✅ All APIs work identically
- ✅ Frontend unchanged
- ✅ Request/response formats same
- ✅ STL generation same quality

**Users won't notice any difference** except possibly:
- Slightly faster performance
- Better error messages
- More reliable operation

---

## 📊 Production Features

### Now Available in Production
✅ **Complete cylinder generation** - All code unified and optimized
✅ **Production logging** - Controlled via LOG_LEVEL env var
✅ **Type-safe requests** - Enums prevent invalid inputs
✅ **Enhanced validation** - Better error messages
✅ **Blob storage caching** - If configured
✅ **Redis caching** - If configured

### Monitoring & Observability
- Set `LOG_LEVEL=INFO` for normal logging
- Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` for verbose debugging
- Check Vercel logs for structured output
- Monitor error rates (should be low/zero)

---

## 🛠️ Environment Variables (Optional)

### For Production Logging
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=INFO  # or DEBUG for verbose
```

### For Caching (If Using)
```bash
# Vercel Blob Storage
BLOB_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-store.public.blob.vercel-storage.com
BLOB_STORE_WRITE_TOKEN=your_token
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_token

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-url
```

### For Security
```bash
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
```
