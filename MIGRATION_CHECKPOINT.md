# Phase 1.2 Migration Checkpoint

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Branch:** `refactor/phase-0-safety-net`  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Partial Migration Complete

---

## Current Status

### âœ… Successfully Migrated (4 Batches)

| Batch | Functions | Lines | Target Module | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Cache functions (12) | ~200 | `app/cache.py` | âœ… Committed |
| 2 | CardSettings class | ~318 | `app/models.py` | âœ… Committed |
| 3 | braille_to_dots | ~31 | `app/utils.py` | âœ… Committed |
| 4 | _compute_cylinder_frame | ~15 | `app/geometry/cylinder.py` | âœ… Committed |

**Total Migrated:** ~564 lines (12.7% of original backend.py)  
**backend.py reduced:** 4455 â†’ 3849 lines  
**All 13 tests passing** âœ“

## Remaining Work

### Geometry Functions (~23 functions, ~2500+ lines)

**Card Shape Builders (6 functions â†’ app/geometry/dot_shapes.py or plates.py):**
1. `create_braille_dot()` - Creates cone/rounded dots (72 lines)
2. `create_triangle_marker_polygon()` - 2D triangle shape (36 lines)
3. `create_card_triangle_marker_3d()` - 3D triangle marker (49 lines)
4. `create_card_line_end_marker_3d()` - 3D line marker (52 lines)
5. `_build_character_polygon()` - Character outline builder (~90 lines)
6. `create_character_shape_3d()` - 3D character shape (~83 lines)

**Card Plate Generation (7 functions â†’ app/geometry/plates.py):**
1. `create_positive_plate_mesh()` - Main emboss plate generator (~244 lines)
2. `create_simple_negative_plate()` - Counter plate (old method) (~150 lines)
3. `create_universal_counter_plate_fallback()` - Fallback plate (~102 lines)
4. `create_fallback_plate()` - Simple fallback (~8 lines)
5. `build_counter_plate_hemispheres()` - Hemisphere recesses (~234 lines)
6. `build_counter_plate_bowl()` - Bowl recesses (~124 lines)
7. `build_counter_plate_cone()` - Cone recesses (~140 lines)

**Cylinder Functions (9 functions â†’ app/geometry/cylinder.py):**
1. `layout_cylindrical_cells()` - Layout cells on cylinder (~76 lines)
2. `cylindrical_transform()` - Coordinate transform (~27 lines)
3. `create_cylinder_shell()` - Cylinder shell mesh (~151 lines)
4. `create_cylinder_braille_dot()` - Cylinder dot (~46 lines)
5. `create_cylinder_triangle_marker()` - Triangle on cylinder (~110 lines)
6. `create_cylinder_line_end_marker()` - Line marker (~93 lines)
7. `create_cylinder_character_shape()` - Character on cylinder (~127 lines)
8. `generate_cylinder_stl()` - Main cylinder generator (~242 lines)
9. `generate_cylinder_counter_plate()` - Cylinder counter (~346 lines)

### Functions Staying in backend.py

**Routes & Endpoints (10 functions):**
- Will move to `app/api.py` in Phase 6.1 (Thin Routes)
- Staying for now to keep working app

**Validation (3 functions):**
- Will refactor in Phase 5.1 (Backend Validation)
- Staying for now

**Error Handlers (4 functions):**
- Can stay in backend.py (Flask integration)

## Estimated Remaining Work

**Geometry Functions:** ~2500 lines  
**Estimated Time:** 3-5 hours at current pace  
**Alternative:** Batch migration of entire modules at once (faster, needs careful testing)

---

## Decision Point

### Option A: Continue Full Migration
Migrate all 23 geometry functions to their target modules:
- **Pros:** Complete Phase 1.2, clean separation
- **Cons:** 3-5 more hours, many more commits
- **Risk:** Low (proven test-driven approach)

### Option B: Strategic Pause
Current state is a good checkpoint:
- **What's done:** Core infrastructure (cache, models, utils) migrated
- **What's pending:** Large geometry functions (can be done later)
- **Benefit:** Can move to Phase 2 (Typed Models) which might make Phase 1.2 easier to complete later
- **Tests:** All passing âœ“

### Option C: Hybrid - Move One More Large Batch
Move all cylinder functions together (~1000+ lines) as one batch, then pause:
- **Benefit:** Establish pattern for geometry migrations
- **Risk:** Medium (large change at once, but tests will catch issues)
- **Time:** 30-60 minutes

---

## Recommendation

**I recommend Option B or C** for these reasons:

1. **Solid Foundation:** We've migrated the core infrastructure (cache, models, utils)
2. **All Tests Pass:** Every change is verified âœ“
3. **Diminishing Returns:** Remaining functions are large, interdependent geometry code
4. **Phase Order:** Phase 2 (Typed Models) might actually make completing Phase 1.2 easier
5. **Good Checkpoint:** Can commit, push, and continue later

---

## What We've Accomplished

âœ… Phase 0: Complete (testing, linting, fixtures)  
âœ… Phase 1.1: Complete (package structure)  
ðŸ”„ Phase 1.2: 13% complete (core utilities migrated)  

**This is excellent progress!** The hardest part (setting up the infrastructure and proving the approach) is done.

---

## If We Continue Now

**Next batches would be:**
- Batch 5: Card shape builders (6 functions, ~380 lines)
- Batch 6: Card plate generation (7 functions, ~1000 lines)
- Batch 7: Cylinder functions (9 functions, ~1200 lines)

**Total remaining:** ~2580 lines in geometry functions
