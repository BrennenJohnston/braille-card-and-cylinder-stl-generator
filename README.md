# Braille Business Card Embossing Plates â€” Beginnerâ€™s Guide

Create tactile, readable braille on ordinary business-card paper with just a 3-D printer, a clamp, and a few minutes in the free program **OpenSCAD**.  This guide walks youâ€”*even if you have never 3-D printed before*â€”through designing, printing, and using custom braille Emboss & Counter plates.

---

## 1. What Youâ€™ll Make

| Part | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Emboss Plate** (raised dots) | Pushes the braille dots *out* of the paper |
| **Counter Plate** (matching recesses) | Supports the paper so dots keep their shape |

Press a card between the two plates and you have braille you can feel and read.

> Vocabulary for experts: Emboss = male/positive, Counter = female/negative.

## 2. Things You Need

| Item                         | Notes |
|------------------------------|-------|
| Computer (Win/Mac/Linux)     | Install **OpenSCAD** (free) & your favourite slicer (Cura, PrusaSlicer, etc.) |
| 3-D printer                  | 0.4 mm nozzle, PLA or PETG filament recommended |
| Clamp / small arbor press    | To squeeze the plates together (even a hand-screw clamp works) |
| Business-card paper          | Use the exact card stock you plan to distribute |
| Digital calipers *(optional)*| Helpful for measuring dot size after your first test |

---

## 3. 5-Minute Quick-Start

1. **Open** `Braille Business Card STL Generator.scad` in OpenSCAD.
2. **View â†’ Customizer**  âžœ fill in your text *in English*.
   - Keep **Grade** set to **Grade 2 (contracted)** unless you have a special reason.
   - Leave all sizes *as-is* for your very first test.
3. **Design â†’ Render (F6)** â†’ **File â†’ Export â†’ STL**.
4. Slice & print both plates flat on the bed.
5. Place a single card between plates & clamp firmly for a few seconds.
6. Feel / measure the dots.  Happy? Great!  Need tweaks?  See Section 7.

> **Tip**â€ƒAlways test with the same paper thickness youâ€™ll use later.  Paper controls the final dot height more than the plastic settings do.

## 4. Video Tutorial

A short screen-recording + live demo will be published here:
`ðŸ‘‰ [YouTube link â€“ coming soon]`

The video covers:
1. Opening the design & entering text
2. Selecting Grade 2 vs 1
3. Exporting STL, slicing, printing
4. Assembling the full tool
5. Embossing a card & inspecting results

## 5. Understanding Grade 1 vs Grade 2

*Regulatory guidance in the US, UK, and elsewhere says use **Grade 2** for English braille by default.*  Grade 1 (uncontracted) is normally reserved for:
- Education / literacy teaching
- Short labels where contractions could confuse
- Situations prescribed by local regulations

Therefore the Customizer defaults to **Grade 2**.

## 6. Why the Default Sizes?  (Dots, Spacing & Sources)

The design aims to **shape the *paper* dots** so they land near widely-accepted targets for paper embossing.

Recommended on-paper dimensions (Specification 800 Â§3.2):

| Parameter                                             | Target |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Dot height                                            | 0.019 in (0.48 mm) |
| Dot base diameter                                     | 0.057 in (1.44 mm) |
| Dot-to-dot distance *within a cell* (horiz/vert)      | 0.092 in (2.34 mm) |
| Cell-to-cell distance (centre-to-centre)               | 0.245 in (6.20 mm) |
| Line spacing (centre-to-centre of nearest dots)       | 0.400 in (10.16 mm) |

> *Important*â€ƒBecause card stock varies, *your* embossed dots may be slightly larger or smaller.  Thatâ€™s normalâ€”start with defaults, then adjust.

## 7. Test â†’ Measure â†’ Adjust (Recommended Workflow)

| Step | What to do |
|------|------------|
| 1. Print a **small test plate** | One or two words is enough |
| 2. **Emboss** a single card | Even, firm pressure |
| 3. **Inspect** | Feel the dots; use calipers if available |
| 4. **Adjust parameters** in the Customizer | See table below |
| 5. **Re-print & re-test** | One or two iterations usually nails it |

Common tweaks:

| Symptom | Try this |
|---------|----------|
| Dots too flat | Increase **Dot Height** or press harder |
| Dots feel sharp | Increase **Apex Rounding** or lower Dot Height |
| Cells crowd | Increase **Cell Advance** or reduce **Dot Diameter** |
| Plates stick together | Increase **Counter Clearance** or add small **Draft** |

## 8. Printing Tips

- **Material**â€ƒPLA is fine; PETG is tougher.  Use 3â€“4 perimeters and 40 % infill for stiffness.
- **Orientation**â€ƒPrint plates *flat* on the bed, embossed surface facing *up*.
- **Quality**â€ƒA slower outer-wall speed (â‰² 30 mm/s) produces smoother dots.

---

## 9. Safety & Handling

- Keep fingers clear of the clamp/press.
- Emboss with controlled force; over-pressing can tear paper or squash dots.

---

## 10. File-Naming & On-Part Labels (Optional but Handy)

Example STL names:
- `BRL_EmbossPlate_Raised_UEB-G2_88x51mm_Dot0p6.stl`
- `BRL_CounterPlate_Recessed_Universal_88x51mm.stl`

Engraved rim labels avoid mix-ups: **EMBOSS (RAISED) â€” MIRRORED** vs **COUNTER (RECESSED)**.

Huge thanks to **Tobi Weinberg** for kick-starting the project and introducing me to Cursor AI.  Without Tobiâ€™s time, effort, and encouragement this program would not exist.
