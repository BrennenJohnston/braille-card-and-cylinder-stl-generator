## üöÄ Quick Start

### What You'll Create

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Embossing Plate** | Creates raised braille dots by pressing into paper |
| **Counter Plate** | Provides backing support with matching recesses |

**Process**: Place business card paper between plates ‚Üí Apply pressure ‚Üí Get professional braille cards!

### üõ†Ô∏è What You Need

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **3D Printer** | 0.4mm nozzle, PLA or PETG recommended |
| **Clamp/Press** | Hand-screw clamp, arbor press, or similar |
| **Card Stock** | Business card paper (exact thickness you'll use) |
| **Slicer Software** | Cura, PrusaSlicer, etc. |
| **Calipers** *(optional)* | For measuring dot accuracy |

### ‚ö° 5-Minute Setup

1. **Visit the web application** at your deployed URL
2. **Enter your text** (up to 4 lines, 50 characters each)
3. **Select language/grade** if needed (defaults to English UEB Grade 2)
4. **Generate embossing plate** ‚Üí Download STL
5. **Generate counter plate** ‚Üí Download STL  
6. **3D print both plates** (flat on bed, embossed surface up)
7. **Test with business card** between plates

> üí° **Pro Tip**: Always test with your actual business card stock first!

## üé• Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow
1. **Enter Text**: Type your business card content (name, title, contact info)
2. **Choose Language**: Select from 50+ braille translation tables
3. **Preview**: See real-time 3D preview of your plates
4. **Download**: Get both embossing and counter plate STL files
5. **Print & Use**: 3D print and create professional braille cards

### Language Support
- **English**: UEB Grade 1 & 2 (default)
- **European**: French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, etc.
- **Nordic**: Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish
- **Slavic**: Polish, Czech, Russian, Bulgarian
- **Asian**: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Arabic
- **Many more**: 50+ total language tables supported

### üìö Grade 1 vs Grade 2 Braille

**Grade 2 (Contracted) - Recommended Default**
- Uses contractions and abbreviations
- Standard for professional braille
- More compact, fewer characters
- Default setting in this application

**Grade 1 (Uncontracted)**  
- Letter-by-letter translation
- Used for technical terms, education
- Longer output
- Available for special cases

### üìè Default Dimensions (Standards-Based)

The application uses professionally-recognized braille specifications:

| Parameter | Value | Standard |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Dot Height** | 1.0mm | NLS Spec 800 |
| **Dot Diameter** | 1.8mm | BANA Guidelines |
| **Cell Spacing** | 6.5mm | UEB Standards |
| **Line Spacing** | 10.0mm | International Standard |
| **Dot Spacing** | 2.5mm | ADA Guidelines |

**Expert Mode** allows full customization of all dimensions.

## üîß Customization & Testing

### Recommended Testing Workflow
1. **Start Small**: Generate plates for 1-2 words first
2. **Test Print**: Use your actual business card stock
3. **Measure Results**: Check dot height and clarity
4. **Adjust Settings**: Use Expert Mode if needed
5. **Iterate**: Usually 1-2 tests get perfect results

### Common Adjustments
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Dots too flat | Increase dot height or apply more pressure |
| Dots too sharp | Reduce dot height |
| Text doesn't fit | Reduce cell spacing or shorten text |
| Poor alignment | Adjust X/Y positioning in Expert Mode |

### üñ®Ô∏è 3D Printing Tips

**Settings:**
- **Material**: PLA (easy), PETG (durable)
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm or finer for smooth dots
- **Infill**: 40%+ for stiffness
- **Perimeters**: 3-4 for strength
- **Speed**: ‚â§30mm/s for outer walls (smoother finish)

**Orientation:**
- Print plates **flat on bed**
- Embossed surface facing **up**
- No supports needed

**Quality:**
- Use quality filament for consistent results
- Ensure bed is level for even dot height
- Consider printing multiple plates for high-volume use

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety & Usage

**Safety:**
- Keep fingers clear when using clamps/presses
- Apply controlled, even pressure
- Test pressure on sample cards first

**Best Practices:**
- Store plates in protective cases
- Clean plates gently with soft brush
- Check alignment before pressing each card
- Use consistent pressure for uniform results

---

## üíæ File Management

**Automatic File Naming:**
- Files named based on your input text
- Clear suffixes: `_braille.stl` (emboss) vs `_counter_plate.stl`
- Sanitized for compatibility across operating systems

**Organization Tips:**
- Create folders by client/project
- Keep emboss and counter plates together
- Document settings used for future reference
