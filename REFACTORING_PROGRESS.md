# Refactoring Progress Report

**Branch:** `refactor/phase-0-safety-net`
**Date:** October 10, 2025
**Status:** Phase 0 Complete, Phase 1.1 Complete

---

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 0: Safety Net & Developer Ergonomics (COMPLETE)

#### 0.1: Baseline Branch & Smoke Tests ✓
- Created refactor branch
- Implemented comprehensive pytest smoke test suite (9 tests)
- Tests cover all 4 STL types: card positive/counter, cylinder positive/counter
- All endpoints verified (health, liblouis tables, STL generation)
- **Runtime:** <5 seconds for all smoke tests

#### 0.2: Tooling (Lint, Types, Hooks) ✓
- Installed development tools: ruff, mypy, pytest, pre-commit
- Created `pyproject.toml` with linting/formatting/testing configuration
- Fixed 408 auto-fixable linting issues
- Documented 40 remaining issues (to be addressed during refactoring)
- Installed pre-commit hooks (run automatically on commit)
- **Result:** Clean, consistent code style

#### 0.3: Golden Test Scaffold ✓
- Created fixture generator script
- Generated 4 golden STL fixtures with metadata
- Implemented 4 regression tests with tolerance-based comparison
- Tests compare face counts, vertex counts, bounding boxes
- **Total Test Suite:** 13 tests (9 smoke + 4 golden)

### Phase 1: Module Layout (IN PROGRESS)

#### 1.1: Create Package Structure ✓
- Created `app/` package with Flask app factory pattern
- Created `app/geometry/` subpackage
- Implemented 8 module files with clear responsibilities:
  - `app/__init__.py` - Flask app factory
  - `app/models.py` - Typed data models and enums
  - `app/api.py` - Routes (placeholder)
  - `app/exporters.py` - STL export utilities (implemented)
  - `app/cache.py` - Caching (placeholder)
  - `app/utils.py` - Utilities (implemented)
  - `app/geometry/*` - 6 geometry modules (placeholders)
- All modules have docstrings and clear purpose
- **Result:** Clean architecture ready for function migration

#### 1.2: Move Functions (PENDING)
- Next step: Extract functions from `backend.py` into new modules
- No logic changes - just reorganization
- Verify tests pass after each major move

## 🧪 How to Test Locally

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest -v

# Run smoke tests only
python -m pytest tests/test_smoke.py -v

# Run golden tests only
python -m pytest tests/test_golden.py -v

# Quick smoke test
python -m pytest tests/ -q

# Check linting
python -m ruff check .

# Format code
python -m ruff format .

# Run the app
python backend.py
# Visit: http://localhost:5001
```

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate: Phase 1.2 - Function Migration
This is the largest single step. It involves:
1. Identify all functions in `backend.py`
2. Group by logical module
3. Move functions to appropriate `app/*` modules
4. Update imports in `backend.py`
5. Wire routes to new locations
6. Run tests after each major group
7. Verify no behavior changes

**Estimated scope:** ~50-100 function moves, will take time and care

### After Phase 1
- Phase 2: Typed Models & Request Validation
- Phase 3: Geometry De-duplication & Purity
- Phase 4: Logging & Error Handling
- Phase 5: Braille Input Validation
- Phases 6-11: See REFACTORING_ROADMAP.md

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### No Git Push Yet
Per your instructions: "We will not push changes to GitHub until changes are made that will only effect the Vercel deployment of the program so as to not be locally testable."

Current status: **All changes are locally testable** - do not push yet.

### Backward Compatibility
The new `app/` package exists alongside `backend.py`. The old code still works.
Phase 1.2 will gradually migrate functions while maintaining compatibility.

### Test Coverage
All existing functionality is covered by:
- 9 smoke tests (endpoint + STL generation)
- 4 golden tests (regression detection)
- Tests run in <5 seconds

## 💡 Recommendations

### Before Proceeding to Phase 1.2
1. **Test locally** - Run the app, generate some STLs, verify everything works
2. **Review structure** - Check if the `app/` package layout makes sense
3. **Approve approach** - Confirm you're happy with the architecture

### During Phase 1.2
- I'll move functions in small batches
- Run tests after each batch
- If anything breaks, we can revert that batch
- Progress updates as we go
