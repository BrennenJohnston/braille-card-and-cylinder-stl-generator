# Minimal dependencies for Vercel serverless deployment
#
# ARCHITECTURE CHANGE (2026-01-05):
# ===================================
# Server-side STL generation removed to eliminate Redis/Blob dependencies.
# Heavy packages (numpy, trimesh, shapely, scipy, matplotlib, manifold3d) removed.
#
# RATIONALE:
# - Client-side CSG handles all boolean operations in the browser
#   (BVH-CSG for cards, Manifold WASM for cylinders)
# - Server only provides lightweight JSON geometry specs via /geometry_spec
# - Eliminates 14-day Upstash Redis inactivity failure mode
# - Reduces deployment package size by ~80%
# - Faster cold starts on Vercel
#
# For local development/testing (includes optional heavy deps + tooling):
#   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
#
# See: docs/development/CODEBASE_AUDIT_AND_RENOVATION_PLAN.md

# Core web framework (REQUIRED)
flask==2.3.3
flask-cors==4.0.0

# REMOVED (2026-01-05):
# Flask-Limiter==3.8.0       # Rate limiting (Vercel provides DDoS protection)
# redis==5.0.7               # Redis client (caused Upstash archived DB failures)
# requests==2.32.3           # HTTP client (only used for blob upload)
# numpy==1.26.4              # Only used by server-side STL generation
# trimesh==4.5.3             # Only used by server-side STL generation
# shapely==2.0.6             # Only used by server-side STL generation
# mapbox_earcut==1.0.2       # Only used by server-side STL generation
